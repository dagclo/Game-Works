# Game Overview

Players control a courier who rides a dragon. Basic core of the game is:
# choose a job
# plan a path
# survive the path
# complete the job

The first prototype I'll focus on is Survive.

## Survive

The courier and their dragon is challenged to survive and endure various encounters in order to continue their journey.
Players will be charged with maintaining the following resources:
* Health - Both courier and dragon will have HP.
** things that can damage HP: attacks, illness, falls, acid, not enough or bad water
** ways to recover: time, magic, medicine
** penalties for low HP: reduced energy/vigilance recovery
** result if depleted: job failure
* Energy - The dragon needs energy to fly/run/etc
** things that can damage energy: not enough or bad food, poison
** ways to recover: brimstone, food, human magic
** penalties for low energy: reduced speed, loss of access to special skills
** result if depleted: required hunt/forage session
* Vigilance - Couriers need to remain alert to ride their dragons
** things that can damage vigilance: not enough or bad shelter (leads to bad sleep), poison
** ways to recover: rest, "coffee", dragon magic
** penalties for low: chances to go off course, special skills may fail
** result if depleted: forced rest
